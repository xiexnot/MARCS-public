# MARCS-public

## Introduction

M2M-based Anticipatory Reasoning for Contexts and Services (MARCS) is the research project supported by NTU IoX Center. It also plays essential part in my master thesis from National Taiwan University. In the full version of MARCS,  engine includes different forms of valuations to measure and analyze. For this branch of MARCS mentioned here, we focus on context discovery using unsupervised methods in real smart home environment.


In my master thesis "Hierarchical Context Discovery, Recognition and Adaptation in Real Smart Environment", the context discovery of MARCS occupies the first component of my system.
